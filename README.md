Merchandise Registration System – CRUD in Python (OOP + Tkinter)

This project was developed as part of a college course with the goal of creating a complete supermarket merchandise registration system using the concepts of:

CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Graphical interface using Tkinter

The program allows users to manage products in a simple and intuitive way, ensuring organization and efficient control over all registered items.

Features
✔️ Create – Register Merchandise

The user can register new products by providing details such as:

Name

✔️ Read – View Merchandise

The system displays a list of all registered products, allowing the user to view their stored information.

✔️ Update – Edit Merchandise

The user can select an existing product and update its information directly through the interface.

✔️ Delete – Remove Merchandise

Allows users to safely and quickly remove products from the system.

Architecture and Code Organization

The project was structured using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to ensure modularity, clear structure, and ease of maintenance.

Interface (Tkinter)

The interface was developed using Tkinter, Python’s built-in library for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
